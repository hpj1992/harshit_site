### Motivation
There is no need to explain the benefits of personal website or a porfolio site, still, I would note down some:

- Personal Branding
- Blog Space
- Makes you discoverable on internet
- One stop resume which works for you
- Helps you learn new skills while building

### Tech Stack

- [Hugo Static Site Builder](https://gohugo.io/)
- Plenty of themplates available at [Hugo Themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/)
- Hosting at [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- Domain from [Godaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/)


### Steps 

- First learn the basics of Hugo and how it works by following [Hugo Quickstart Guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/)
- Once somewhat comfortable with Markdown and Hugo, choose a [template/theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/) for your site
 - You can create your custom theme as well.
- After choosing a theme, customize your site based on your need. 
- Verify your site locally at http://localhost:1313 (Assuming you did not change the config) 
- At this point, your stack is setup to build your site locally.
- Finish multiple iterations of changes till you are satisfied with the website you want to build.

### Deployment

- Once site is built, it is time to host and deploy it somewhere. 

##### Hosting 
- There are multiple options to host your static website. Eg: Github pages, BitBucket, Netlify, GitLab 
- In my case, I used GitHub Pages and deployed site at - [hpj1992.github.io](http://hpj1992.github.io/)
- I use this site as a pre-production/staging environment for my site.
- Not including detailed information because there plenty of resources available online. [Hugo instructions on hosting and deployment.](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/)

##### Domain
- Once you figure out the hosting issues, it is time to purchase a domain for your website. 
- If you do not want specifc domain - which is perfectly valid - you can start sharing links from your hosted environment.
- If you do decide to purchase a domain, there are multiple options in this case as well and the best option varies based on individual. Eg: GoDaddy, Bluehost etc
- Some [well known domain providers are listed here.](https://www.predictiveanalyticstoday.com/domain-registration-providers/)
- I selected a domain with name:
 - Domain registration for 1 year with auto-renewel. Paid $10/year.
 - Privacy protection for domain for 1 year. Paid $10/year.
 - Did not opt for HTTPS certificate because I do not need it currently.
- Followed this youtube tutorial to [link my GoDaddy domain to Github Pages.](https://youtu.be/mPGi1IHQxFM)
