Where vision meets execution. I design systems that scale, adapt, and anticipateâ€”from LLM-powered customer experiences to high-performance data pipelines processing millions of events in minutes. My decade in software engineering at Amazon has been defined by turning complex technical challenges into elegant solutions that drive measurable impact. I don't just build software; I craft experiences that reshape how technology serves people.
